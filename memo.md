for hexa, better use regulr expression

when try cmyk=50,50,50,50, HSL not working correctly

Switch available in HSLtoRGB?

in Hexa input, seperate # and the rest

should remove Math.round in RGBtoCMYK?

when moving pointer, result codes are different everytime

color name display not working if hexa input is not capital cases

Need both oninput and onchange for each input?


Is it possible to make Frame component nest its children like CNLabel,range,label and so on in styledComponent.jsx?
If possible, no need to pass the same props textColor in many component, just pass it only from the parent, Frame component.

In hambugerDiv, there is a div, why? If not necessary, remove it.

Which is better, with or without Math.round() in each input value attribute and inputRangeBG function?
