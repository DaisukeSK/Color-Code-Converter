Welcome to Color Code Converter.<br/>

This is an app made with React.js + TypeScript.<br/>
It provides you multiple kinds of color codes of any color.(HSL, HSV, Hexa, RGB and CYMK)<br/>

On the lower side, you can pick up any color from color space on the left side, input bars or input field of Hexa color, and it gives you color codes of the picked color on the upper side.<br/>
You can also copy those color codes by clicking copy icons on the right side, and change opacity too.<br/>

The humburger menu on the top left allows you to pick up built-in colors.<br/>

I hope you like it!!
